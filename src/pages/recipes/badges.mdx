## Badges

artifact.ci also provides a `badge` action, a thin wrapper around the artifact upload action which uses the [badge-maker](https://github.com/badges/shields) library (from sheilds.io) to generate badges.

```yaml
- uses: mmkal/artifact.ci/badge@main
  with:
    label: result
    message: checkmate
    logo: chessdotcom
    color: brown
    labelColor: lightgrey
```

(`message` is required, everything else is optional. `logo` can be a slug from [simple-icons](https://simpleicons.org))

The result will be a URL looking something like this (available as a step output named `badge-url-branch`):

https://artifactci-git-badge-action-mmkals-projects.vercel.app/artifact/view/mmkal/artifact.ci/branch/badge-action/result/badge.svg

It will render like this:

![result checkmate](https://artifactci-git-badge-action-mmkals-projects.vercel.app/artifact/view/mmkal/artifact.ci/branch/badge-action/result/badge.svg)

The advantage of using the badge action over, say, the shields.io API, is that the URL will be stable, but the badge itself will update when the workflow is run again.

Note: for branch URLs, the server sends a 5-minute cache header, but for run and sha URLs, it sends a one-year cache header.
