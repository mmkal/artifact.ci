## Badges

artifact.ci also provides a `badge` action, a thin wrapper around the artifact upload action which uses the [badge-maker](https://github.com/badges/shields) library to generate badges.

```yaml
- uses: mmkal/artifact.ci/badge@main
  with:
    label: result
    message: checkmate
    logo: chess.com
    color: brown
    labelColor: lightgrey
```

The result will be a URL something like this:

https://artifact.ci/artifact/view/github/mmkal/artifact.ci/branch/badge-action/custom-action/result/badge.svg

It will render like this:

![result checkmate](https://artifact.ci/artifact/view/github/mmkal/artifact.ci/branch/badge-action/custom-action/result/badge.svg)

The advantage of using the badge action over, say, the shields.io API, is that the URL will be stable, but the badge itself will update when the workflow is run again.
