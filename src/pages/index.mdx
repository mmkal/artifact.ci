# artifact.ci

## What is this?

A GitHub App that provides browsable links for artifacts uploaded during GitHub Actions workflow runs.

It's a small tool which solves a [specific shortcoming of GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/14).

To use it, all you need to do is install the app. Then use `actions/upload-artifact` as normal in your workflow. It will add a link to view any artifacts uploaded via GitHub checks.

import '../styles/docs.css'
export function InstallButton() {
    return <a 
      className="install-button"
      style={{
        margin: '1rem 0',
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        gap: '0.5rem',
        padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
        borderRadius: '0.5rem',

<InstallButton />

Here's an end-to-end example of a repo installing the app, then using vitest's HTML report to view test results in-browser:

export function DemoVideo() {
    return <video
      muted
      autoPlay
      playsInline
      onClick={ev => {
        /** @type {HTMLVideoElement} */
        // @ts-expect-error whatever
        const video = ev.target
        if (video.paused) void video.play()
        else void video.pause()
      }}
      >
      <source src={`/artifact.ci-demo.webm`} type="video/mp4" />
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
}

<br />
<br />
<DemoVideo />

Here's an example of what the GitHub App produces, on the [expect-type](https://github.com/mmkal/expect-type) repo: it's a simple link to the viewable artifact as a GitHub check: https://github.com/mmkal/expect-type/runs/31567129309

## Why

CI jobs often generate useful HTML reports (test results, coverage, etc.). GitHub Actions doesn't provide a way to view these directly. The existing option is to use `actions/upload-artifact`, then download it as a zip file, unzip it on your local machine, and then poke around at the files or run a local server. This app fills that gap, letting you view artifacts in your browser without downloading and unzipping.

This _should_ really be a feature built into GitHub, and likely one day will be, but [for now it isn't](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/14). (Note: it is built into some other CI providers like CircleCI).

## Usage

Guides for common tools:

### Testing frameworks

- [Vitest](/recipes/testing/vitest)
- [Playwright](/recipes/testing/playwright)
- [Jest](/recipes/testing/jest)
- [Mocha](/recipes/testing/mocha)
- [AVA](/recipes/testing/ava)

### Other languages

- [Python](/recipes/other-languages/python)
- [Go](/recipes/other-languages/go)

### More

- [Static websites](/recipes/more/website)
- [PDFs](/recipes/more/pdf)

...you get the idea. If you can render it statically in a web browser, you can upload it to artifact.ci.

## Security

The app requires minimal permissions, operates read-only, and uses GitHub's APIs and authentication. It maintains your repository's existing access controls. See [the privacy policy](/privacy) for more details.

## Who

This is [my](https://x.com/mmkalmmkal) side project, something I built initially for my own use in support of another project I'm working on.

## Pricing

The actual service doesn't have a paywall for now, and usage is free to start out with. Access may be limited to my [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mmkal) due to storage costs. I'm giving some users and organizations free access - this is based on how much I use them myself, but if you would like to use this without sponsorship, [contact me](https://x.com/mmkalmmkal).

## Availability

There's no API surface right now. Just install the app and it should "just work" - it'll find your artifacts automatically. Options may be added in future to customise how the artifact is stored (for example, defining content-disposition headers, or making access to certain files public rather tha private). Usage limits may be introduced in future, or a proper payments setup.

Note that the GitHub team have mentioned a built-in solution is on their radar, so hopefully this will only be necessary for a short while.
